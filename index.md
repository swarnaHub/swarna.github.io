I am a Research Engineer in the Industry Research group at [IBM Research - India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/). My research area is at the intersection of NLP and its applications to educational technologies. I have worked extensively on the problem of Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) for the [Watson Tutor](https://www.ibm.com/watson/education/pearson) (CIKM 2018, AIED 2018). I am also involved in building a virtual medical tutor for [NTU](http://www.lkcmedicine.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx), wherein I lead the NLP efforts for content understanding to enable personalized learning.

Before joining IBM Research, I was an M.Tech student and a Teaching Assistant in the Computer Science & Engineering department of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi from 2015-2017. I was affiliated with the [Data Analytics and Intelligence Research Group](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/dair/) and was advised by [Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/). In my masters thesis, I improved the state-of-the-art Open Information Extraction ([Open IE 5.0](https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone)) system by generating better extractions from numerical sentences (ACL 2017) and conjunctive sentences (COLING 2018).

I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering from Jadavpur University, India in 2014. Following my B.Tech, I spent a year working as a Software Developer in the Acrobat Reader team of Adobe Systems, India. My broad research interests are in Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics and Machine Learning. In NLP, my specific research areas are Information Extraction, Textual Entailment and various educational applications of NLP.
