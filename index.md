I am a second year CS PhD student in the [MURGe Lab](https://murgelab.cs.unc.edu/) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, advised by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/). I also work closely with [Prof. Shashank Srivastava](https://www.ssriva.com/) and other members of the bigger [UNC NLP Lab](https://nlp.cs.unc.edu/). Broadly, my research focuses on developing explainable and robust NLP models for the tasks of Question Answering ([EMNLP 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02830)), Natural Language Inference ([EMNLP 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10418)) and Commonsense Reasoning. In the past, I have also spent some time understanding the nuances of conjunctions in English ([EMNLP 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10418), [COLING 2018](https://swarnahub.github.io/papers/COLING18.pdf)).

Previously, I spent two wonderful years at [IBM Research - India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/) building industry-scale Intelligent Tutoring Systems (IJCAI 2019, CIKM 2018, AIED 2018). Before that, I was an M.Tech. student in the CS department at IIT, Delhi, having worked with [Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/) and developed the state-of-the-art Open Information Extraction system ([Open IE 5.0](https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone)) (ACL 2017, COLING 2018). I also spent a year working as a Software Developer in the Acrobat Reader team at Adobe, India after completing by bachelors from Jadavpur University, India.
