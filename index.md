I am a Research Engineer in the Watson Education group at [IBM Research - India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/). At IBM, I build industry-scale Intelligent Tutoring Systems by developing novel machine learning models for Automatic Short Answer Grading (arXiv 2019, CIKM 2018, AIED 2018), content understanding (IJCAI 2019) and other real-world Natural Language Understanding problems.

Before joining IBM Research, I was an M.Tech. student and a Teaching Assistant in the Computer Science & Engineering department of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi from 2015-2017. I was affiliated with the [Data Analytics and Intelligence Research Group](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/dair/) and was advised by [Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/). In my master's thesis, I developed the widely used Open Information Extraction system ([Open IE 5.0](https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone)) (ACL 2017, COLING 2018).

I completed my B.E. in Computer Science & Engineering from Jadavpur University, India in 2014 and also spent a year working as a Software Developer in the Acrobat Reader team of Adobe Systems, India. I love language and develop computational models for understanding language, primarily in the areas of Information Extraction, Natural Language Inference and Question Answering. My broad research interests are in Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
