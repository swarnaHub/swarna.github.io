I am a Research Engineer in the Watson Education group at [IBM Research - India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/). At IBM, I conduct research at the intersection of NLP and its applications to educational technologies. I have worked extensively on the problem of Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) for the [Watson Tutor](https://www.ibm.com/watson/education/pearson) (CIKM 2018, AIED 2018). I am also involved in building a virtual medical tutor for [NTU](http://www.lkcmedicine.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx), wherein I lead the NLP efforts for content understanding in medical domain to enable personalized learning.

Before joining IBM Research, I was an M.Tech. student and a Teaching Assistant in the Computer Science & Engineering department of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi from 2015-2017. I was affiliated with the [Data Analytics and Intelligence Research Group](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/dair/) and was advised by [Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/). In my master's thesis, I improved the state-of-the-art Open Information Extraction system ([Open IE 5.0](https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone)) by generating better extractions from numerical sentences (ACL 2017) and conjunctive sentences (COLING 2018). Drawing inspiration from my work on understanding conjunctions, I have recently started analyzing the capability of current Natural Language Inference systems in making inferences for conjunctive sentences.

I completed my B.E. in Computer Science & Engineering from Jadavpur University, India in 2014. Following my B.E., I spent a year working as a Software Developer in the Acrobat Reader team of Adobe Systems, India. My broad research interests are in Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In NLP, my specific research areas are Information Extraction, Natural Language Inference, QA, Intelligent Tutoring Systems and various other educational applications.
